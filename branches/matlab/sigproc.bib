    abstract = {{A concept for the optimization of nonlinear functions using
particle swarm methodology is introduced. The evolution of several
paradigms is outlined, and an implementation of one of the paradigms is
discussed. Benchmark testing of the paradigm is described, and
applications, including nonlinear function optimization and neural
network training, are proposed. The relationships between particle swarm
optimization and both artificial life and genetic algorithms are
described}},
